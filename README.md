# When Was the Golden Age of Video Games ? 
## Overview
Video games are big business, with the global gaming market projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027. In this project, we explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

## Objectives
The main objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between game sales and critic and user reviews to determine whether or not the quality of video games has improved over time. We also aim to identify any trends in the data, such as which platforms or publishers are associated with the highest-rated or best-selling games.

## Tools and Technologies
We used the following tools and technologies in this project:

- Python 3.9
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
## Results
Our analysis revealed several interesting insights about the video game industry:

Game sales have increased dramatically over time, with over 1.3 billion copies of the top 400 games sold.
There is a weak correlation between game sales and critic and user reviews, suggesting that sales are not solely determined by game quality.
Some platforms and publishers are associated with higher-rated or better-selling games, but there is no clear pattern across the entire dataset.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, while video game sales have grown significantly over time, there is no clear evidence that the quality of games has improved in step with this growth. The relationship between game sales and critic and user reviews is complex and cannot be fully explained by quality alone. Further research is needed to understand the factors that drive video game sales and popularity.
